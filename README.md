# Aram Al-Hussein

**ERP Systems Architect & Senior Full-Stack Developer**

I design and deliver scalable, production-ready ERP and business systems where
system architecture, backend logic, and workflows are aligned with real operational needs.

My work focuses on building modular platforms that support long-term growth,
data integrity, and data integrity, and secure access control — not demos or short-lived solutions.

> Most of my production work involves internal ERP systems and private deployments.
> Source code is primarily maintained locally or in restricted environments.
> Selected repositories here are shared for demonstration and portfolio purposes.
