# Aram Al-Hussein

**ERP Systems Architect & Senior Full-Stack Developer**

I design and deliver scalable, production-ready ERP and business systems where
system architecture, backend logic, and workflows are aligned with real operational needs.

My work focuses on building modular platforms that support long-term growth,
data integrity, and secure access control not demos or short-lived solutions.
