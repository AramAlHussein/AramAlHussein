# Aram Al-Hussein
### Backend Engineer | ERP System Designer | Laravel | Secure & Structured Business Applications

I design and deliver scalable, production-ready ERP and business systems where architecture, backend logic, and workflows are aligned with real operational needs.

My focus is on building modular platforms that support long-term growth, data integrity, and secure access control — systems designed for real teams, real data, and real-world usage.

Most of my professional work involves internal ERP platforms and private deployments under strict NDAs.  
Public repositories here are intentionally limited and shared only for demonstration and portfolio purposes.
